\section{ABSTRACT}
Gesture controlled robot  is a  robot which can be controlled by simple gesture. The user just needs to wear a gesture device which include a sensor. The sensor will record the movement of hand in a specific direction which will result in the movement of the robot in the respective direction. The robot and the gesture device are connected wirelessly via radio waves. The wireless communication enables the user to interact  with the robot in a more friendly way.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Nowadays, people want to keep everything in their hands. As if doing all of the hand signals. Recently, strong efforts have been carried out to develop intelligent and natural interfaces between users and computer based systems based on human gestures.A robot is an electro-mechanical system that is operated by a computer program.Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous.An autonomous robot is not controlled by human and acts on its own decision by sensing its environment. Thus, such gesture-based interfaces can not only substitute the common interface devices, but can also be exploited to extend their functionality.


\section{MOTIVATION}
Motivation is the reason for people's actions, willingness and goals. Our motivation to work on this project came from a disabled person who was driving his wheel chair by hand with quite a lot of difficulty. So we wanted to make a device which would help such people drive their chairs without even having the need to touch the wheels of their chairs. The wheel chair will be run by their gesture

\section*{iV.L298N Driver}
L298N Driver. The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver which allows speed and direction control of two DC motors at the same time. The module has two screw terminal blocks for the motor A and B, and another screw terminal block for the Ground pin, the VCC for motor and a 5V pin which can either be an input or output.

\section*{V.DC Motor and Wheel}
DC Gear Motor and Wheel. Our DC gear motor and wheel set for making robots! These motors are light weight, high torque and low RPM. They can climb hills and have excellent traction, plus you can mount the wheel on either side of the motor with its double-sided output shaft.

\section*{Vi.Mini Breadboard}
Anatomy of a Mini Breadboard. ... These tie points take the form of holes within the breadboard, into which wires and components can be pushed. They're useful for basic prototyping, but breadboards don't accommodate anything with two closely spaced rows of pins, such as the header on the Raspberry Pi.

\section*{Vii.Jumper Wires}
A jump wire (also known as jumper wire, or jumper) is an electrical wire, or group of them in a cable, with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them – simply "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering
